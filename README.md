### Wave

Site has been tested at [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://rackstorm.github.io/Code-Institute_Project-1/) with good results. The only alert was that there is a
redundant link to the index.html. This because both the logo and the Home-button shares the same url.

# Deployment

## Setting it up

TEXT

## Adding, committing and pushing code

- All code has been pushed to the repository https://github.com/Rackstorm/Code-Institute_Project-1
- All code has been regurlary added, committed and pushed throughout the project.
- The commands being used are `git add <file>`,
  `git commit -m “commit message”` and
  `git push`
- Due to being completely brand new into this tech world, the `git commit -m “commit message”` have gradually improved throughout this project since it was difficult for me to understand the importance of good logging in the beginning.
